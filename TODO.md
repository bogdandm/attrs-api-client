- Remove OrderedDict (dictionaries in Python 3.7 are now ordered)
- Features
    - Models layer
        - [X] Data variant converting
            - [ ] Change empty dict to actual dict type, not empty models
        - [X] Data variant merging
        - [X] Create and register models
        - [X] Merge meta-models and extract common ones
        - [ ] Save meta-models as python code
            - [X] typing code generation
                - [ ] (Maybe in future) Extract to another module (by serializers for each dynamic typing class)
            - [X] attrs
            - [ ] dataclasses
            - [ ] generate from_json/to_json converters
        - [ ] Model class -> Meta format converter
            - [ ] attrs
            - [ ] dataclasses
        - [ ] Implement existing models registration
            - [ ] attrs
            - [ ] dataclasses
            - [ ] Decorator to mark class as exclude from models merge
        - Other features
            - [ ] Decode unicode in keys
            - [ ] Nesting models generation
                - [X] Cascade (default)

                - [ ] Decorator to specify field metatype
                - [ ] Specify metatype in attr/dataclass argument (if dataclasses has such)
            - [ ] String based types (Warning: 6 times slow down)
